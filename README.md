# intellectual-capital
This repository contains the data and code to determine the effect of intellectual capital (and its components) on  on the financial performance of mining companies. It was developed as a project for the Research Center at the Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP). Our findings suggest a statistically significant effect of value-added intellectual capital (VAIC) and human capital efficiency (HCE) on Return on Assets (ROA), as well as a small but significant effect of relational capital efficiency (RCE) on the Market to Book Ratio (MTB). No significant effect was observed on Q-Tobin.
